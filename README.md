# 🌱 Automatic Plant Watering System  

An **electronics project** that automatically waters plants using a **soil moisture sensor, relay module, and water pump**.  
This project was developed as part of a **B.Sc. Electronics final year project (2022–2023)** at  
*Shri Dnyaneshwar Maskuji Burungale Science & Arts College, Shegaon*.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The system monitors soil moisture using a sensor and controls a 5V relay to switch a water pump on/off.  
When the soil becomes dry, the pump is activated to water the plant until the soil reaches the desired moisture level.  

This automation ensures:  
- ✅ Consistent watering  
- ✅ Saves time  
- ✅ Conserves water  
- ✅ Promotes healthy plant growth

## 🚀 Features  
- 🌿 **Automatic Irrigation** – Waters plants when soil is dry  
- 💧 **Water Conservation** – Reduces water waste by watering only when needed  
- ⏳ **Time-Saving** – No manual watering required  
- 🔌 **Simple Circuit** – Built with basic electronic components  
- 🏡 **Applications** – Indoor gardening, greenhouses, hydroponics, outdoor plant care

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- 5V Relay Module  
- 5V Water Pump  
- Power Supply (5V)  
- Jumper Wires  
- Soldering Kit & Breadboard  

---

## 🔧 Circuit Design  
The system is designed **without Arduino** or any microcontroller programming.  

**Working Flow:**  
1. Soil moisture sensor detects dryness  
2. Signal triggers a relay through a transistor  
3. Relay switches ON the water pump  
4. Pump waters the plant until soil moisture is restored
